MSBA 503 Take-Home Assignment

Project Overview

This project explores object detection using deep learning algorithms. Two algorithms from the computer vision domain are compared in terms of:

Processing time
Number of objects detected
Confidence probabilities for detections
Additionally, other insights were extracted from the images using supplementary methods.

Technologies Used

Python 3.x
Libraries: TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV, Matplotlib

The comparison of algorithms is summarized as follows:

Image	Algorithm 1	Algorithm 2
1	Time: X sec
Objects: Y
Confidence: Z%	Time: A sec
Objects: B
Confidence: C%
...	...	...

YOLO was faster but less accurate compared to RCNN.
RCNN performed better in detecting smaller objects.
Additional Insights

Using non-deep learning methods, additional attributes such as color histograms or edge detection were extracted.
